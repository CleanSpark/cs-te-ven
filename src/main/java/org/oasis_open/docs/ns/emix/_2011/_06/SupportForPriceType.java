/**
 * Support for Price conveys information that supports the prices on the outside of the envelope. It was originally conceived that there might be an array of products with associated prices. An example is the wholesale purchase of a product, along with transport products to establish a base cost to support a contracted retail price. Without further defintion, support for price is not restricted in this way as of v1.0, and Parties that wish to exchange price support should extend this type to meet their needs.
